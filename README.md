# Production-Boosts-Updated
Forked (Production Boosts mod)[https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/66] and updated broken parts of that mod, namely the increased resources. 

Just install the Production Boost mod and then override it with these files. 

No longer gives greyed out building icon for clay pits, hunting cabin, cotton mills, rum, and gold mine. Unsure if there's more greyed out icons, these are just the main ones I've found in the old/new world.
