# Production-Boosts-Updated
Forked (Production Boosts mod)[https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/66] and updated broken parts of that mod, namely the increased resources. GU17

Just install the Production Boost mod and then override it with these files. 

No longer gives greyed out building icon for clay pits, hunting cabin, cotton mills, rum, and gold mine. Unsure if there's more greyed out icons, these are just the main ones I've found in the old/new world. 

Refined production boost will no longer give double input and fixed the storage amount not working.
